# Phase 1 Project Description-Cameron Blakeley


## Project Overview

For this project, I will use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. I am charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. I then translated those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)



### Key Points

* **Microsoft should make films within the Action/Adventure Genre** Whilst parsing the data for analysis, it was clear that the "Action & Adventure" genre are the most popular films today according to the popularity ranking system provided by TheMovieDB.org. It was clear that films that are above the 50 value ranking tend to increase viewrship and audience voting engagement  

* **Microsfot should consider making Animated films within the Action/Adventure Genre.** Of the top 10 domestic grossing films in 2010, all of them were under the Action/Adventure genre label and 50% of them were Animated. It is clear that even within the Action/Adventure genre, Animation films are a viable option for ROI. 

* **Microsoft should stick to the 135-138 minutes per film range.** When analyzing the data for the audience engagement based on total number of votes per film versus the average runtime per minutes per film, it was clear that the more popular films had a average runtime of 138 minutes. While the unpopular movies had an average runtime of 94 minutes. Which leads to conclude that people tend to enjoy movies within the 135-138 minutes runtime more than the latter.
